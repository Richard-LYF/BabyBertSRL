# BabyBERTSRL

## Background

This repository contains code that runs Allen AI's implementation of a BERT-based SRL labeler. 
A demo can be found [here](https://demo.allennlp.org/semantic-role-labeling). 

The paper describing the original implementation (Shi et al., 2019)can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05255).
