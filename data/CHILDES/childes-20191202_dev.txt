well let me think of a harder one than that . how much is five plus ten plus five ? i know one you ca not get . how much is five times five ? well how much is six times five ? well i am going to have_to get an even harder one than that . how much is thirty minus fifteen ? well we better get into more higher math then think so ? well let us see you have answered all the questions that i have asked you . let us see if you can ask some questions ask me some questions that i ca not answer . that would be a million times a thousand . is that a billion ? haha . i think it is a million . well that is getting kind of ridiculous let us answer one that i can work in my or let us ask one that i can work on in my head . goodness i do not know i know something that you have forgotten . because we have not done it in so long . i want to see if you can remember how to name the presidents starting from the first one up to the current one ? have you forgotten them ? well let me see . now talk in your normal voice . that is okay first i need to get some background like where you . okay [NAME] tell me about your lego set here what all have you built ? well what is it ? what is this over here ? well what does it do . would you show me how it works ? where is it going ? where is it going to go ? have you got a launch ? if it launched off though . it would not be going anywhere ?

show me how it works . for four year olds uh ? what did you all do at kindergarten today ? why ? at rest time you must have been playing hard on the play+ground . what were you all playing ? is this any particular kind of game ? any kind of particular game you were playing ? where you chase each_other . were the girls playing too were you all running away from the girls or . well did you catch them ? what did you do if you caught them ? oh . okay you all play any more soccer ? whose team were you on ? who else ? you all keep score ? who won ? have you learned how to kick a goal yet ? have you made any points ? good . uh huh . have you learned how to block it so_that somebody else does not score points ? oh you are not ? oh . okay those are the rules in kindergarten huh ? okay well you have_to play by the rules do not you ? well tell me what you all do in sunday school . since [NAME] knows your teacher . because i am going to ask you . i was not there sunday [NAME] . three weeks ago . you were not there . you were not there the last time i was there . that must have been the night you spent the night at grandmommy and granddaddy is . was that the sunday you made valentines ? what are you working on now [NAME] ? i mean right now here on your lego set are you rearranging it ? building something else . did you and [NAME] talk about your tornado nap awhile ago ? did you ? oh you already talked about it . okay . well you can go ahead and start playing that game if you want to . okay which game do you want to play ? well we could work on your activity book . you want to do something in your activity book ? some of those word games . well why do not we do some of those that would be better . okay okay we are going to need a pencil you got a pencil [NAME] ? i do not know if i can hear you . okay an extra pencil please . i only have a pen . that ought to work . okay . okay [NAME] . okay the x_man fill in is that what we are going to do ? okay why do not you read me the directions and i will see what we are supposed to do . okay ah this is like the cross+word puzzle right you have_to figure out where all these words go . okay can you read them ? okay then so we have_to find the place where that is going to fit in . okay . uh huh makes like a cross+word puzzle . this is a different kind of cross+word puzzle . well we have_to see how many words have four spaces in them and i think i only see one place . can you find it look around and see it is going down . no see that is a whole word right there that would be too big . what about right there ? yeah but it will when we get them all filled in see they are going to all go together . see in this kind of cross+word puzzle they do not give you the clues they just give you the words but you have_to figure out where they go . okay well you can check that one off . right just so you know you did it okay now pick another word that see they have got them separated into how many letters are in the word . okay now we are going to have_to look around for a. that is right . and what does it end in ? okay that must be it okay . okay there is one more with five letters . that is teens . that would be like if you are age thirteen to nineteen you would be in your teens . a teenager . i do not know why that is in there . it looks like a kind of strange word for superheroes does not it ? maybe so but if you look around there will be one more word with five letters in it . one more word a five letter word can you find where that is ? uh huh . okay well all those four have seven letters so_that might be a little harder because you are going to have_to figure out the right place to put it . okay that is seven letters so that will be a hint . it could be either that one or that one could not it ? well let us see where the other seven letter ones are . well it is going to be hard i tell you what let us figure out what word this is . it will give you a hint find a word down there that starts with a c. one two three four five six seven it has eight letters . there is only one word with eight letters is not there ? that is colossus . is that a person in superheroes ? you never heard of that one ? okay i will write that one down . see then this is going to give you a hint um the other words that go across this way . one two three four five six seven . okay so one is here seven letter words that will go in there . which one would that be ? the fourth letter has_to be the f does not it ? okay what word is this ? banshee is that in superheroes ? i do not know about that .
what you laughing about ? why do not you .
