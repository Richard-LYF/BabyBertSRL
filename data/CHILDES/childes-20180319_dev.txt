right on your door . okay i 'll take them to work and tell them that my son made them them for me okay ? what are we going to do next ? i do n't know . maybe some reading . we have n't done reading for a long time . let me think . we could try to learn work on a book . okay . put some of this over here . what is that that 's a little pelican ?

you can put this guy here .
you 're kind of trapped right ? you 're trapped ! yeah if you moved him up here then that would be bad move . you you have_to leave him there so it blocks me . i 'm sad because no one brought me a present . yeah . is that right ross ? marky that 's not fair . what does that mean ? does n't he say bomit ? yeah he says bomit . ross you just make your daddy 's life hard you know ? gee ross i 've got a_lot_of work to do . do you know what i mean ? is that pretending ? no that 's not pretending . what were you you pretending ? i see . then he fell down for real by accident . yeah and it was an accident . it was an accident . mark ? what mommy what ? are there six more shows . the third eye . xxx . five and six more shows ? no wait . how many more shows ? that 's not right . how many have they had so far ? and how many are left ? right . and what are there names ? number ? good . how many ? ha ha ha . he said there are two more left . oh . jump mark jump . ross ? do n't push him do n't push him . are there six shows . in all . how many in all ? that 's what i did n't want you to do . ow ! i did n't push you ! ross do you know how to put the under_roo 's away ? yeah just drop them in the right place . did you do a good job on it ross ? okay . do you want to have any tapes ? yeah . but i might leave anyway . so what are we going to do have tapes or not ? how come ? okay good . marky has_to have him first . well just go hide it in a place somewhere where no one will will find it . where mommy and daddy ca n't find it ! well how are you going to remember in the morning where it is ? what do you mean ? ross let 's talk about whether you should give sean the sword . now why do n't you want this ? to be friends with another boy . you what ? but um okay i understand what you are saying . but then how is sean going to feel ? well think about how you feel when other people have you ever ever been a kid and they do n't play with you ? other kids wo n't play with you ? how does that feel ? you do n't feel too bad in that situation ? just find another kid to play with ? and then do n't you need more that one kid to play with ? what if no one with play with you ? no one at all . what if your brother wo n't play with you ? brothers always play huh ? well what if there really really was horrible and even the brother would n't play ? that 's smart ross . he 's a smart+alec is n't he ? so you think sean should 've done that because no one was being being nice to him he should 've just left ? that 's a good idea . so you do n't ever want to be nice to sean huh ? how come ? well how about grandma ? are you ever going to be nice to her ? she pokes you ? she does n't always poke you . she likes you ross . grandma really likes you . she buys things presents for your birthday . what if she promised not to do that anymore ? what if we got grandma to promise not to poke you anymore would you like her then ? no but what if she really stopped it ? no wait ross what if she stopped it then why would you be mad at her ? but you 're going to get old someday too . well how old is your mommy ? because you should learn how old your mommy is that 's how you you should know . your mommy 's thirty eight . when you write on the the mothers day present for her and on her birthday present you have_to to know how old she is . okay ? are you going to be mean to old people ? just because grandma is old are you going to be mean to her ? think about it . you have your own body ? kind of but sometimes you have_to think about other people like like sean and grandma and . no one makes you and you should n't yell . because people i 'll tell you the reason . do you remember about about god ? do you remember god ? okay god wanted people to be nice to each_other . you do n't believe in god ? okay well then what makes you want to be nice to other people ? yeah but what if other people were nasty to you ? and you would n't have any more friends . so maybe it 's a good idea to be friends with kids . think about it . just think about the idea of being nice to everybody . let 's think about a world where everyone is nice . i 'm not bossing you . i 'm asking you to use your head . you do n't want to think about other people huh ? you do n't think about being nice to other children ? well think about think about your own brain being nice to other kids . okay i 'll tell you the rules . do you want me to tell you the rules ? then i should tell you beforehand ? okay every time you go to a party with kids . listen let me tell the whole rules . i 'll tell you the whole deal . whenever you go to a party with kids you have_to be nice to all the kids . when you go to school you have_to be nice to all the kids at school . and when you go on a picnic and a boy scout party you have_to be be nice to all those kids to and you 'll have_to be nice to all the kids you ever see and when you go to the mall you have_to be nice to everybody . ross that 's not nice to your father . your father 's heart is going to break ross . yes . that 's it and there 'll be no more father for you . well then you 'll be nasty to her and her heart will break . but they 're too old and you do n't love them . well but if you do n't love them if you want to just be nice to me i 'm not really old and i do n't poke my finger in you and you can have a better deal by being nice to me so i would n't die . you do ? but you did n't want to talk about my things i was talking about . it 's not with your body . ross it 's not your body you 're doing things . because you have a good little heart . you want to really listen to the answer ? wait a second . wait . it means that there is an answer to your question . are you ready to listen to the answer ? in your heart you know right here where your heart is ? you 're not listening . right in here is your heart . if you have a good lovely chocolate heart then you want to be be good to other people . if you have a mean hexy heart sketzy heart . do you know what what sketzies were like ? then you want to be mean to other people . are you a sketzy ? yeah ? why ? the grogg in raggedy ann ? now if your brother falls and you have a warm heart then you 'll go and you 'll help him . you do n't have a warm nice heart ? you do n't to be a friend of brothers ? see i know you love brothers . okay no more talking about it . i 'm not going to boss you ever again . i 'm finished bossing . i know you have good warm heart and you 'll do it for your own sake and not for mine anymore . so that 's the end of my bossing you . really ? that 's a dirty trick . are you going to try to do things so_that they 'll make me mad ? no okay . no that 's not the dirty trick that 's not the deal . the deal is that i just stop bossing you and you do the good things for yourself . hey daddy xxx . yeah he 's short and ugly . is n't he ugly ? he 's the ugliest of all those guys . he looks like a mer+man . mer+man ? because he 's fat and big and real ugly . do n't you thing he 's ugly ? he 's cute ? he looks like a little twerp . no . he looks like twerp . is this a picture of you ?

what is this thing at his feet ? ross said he has short legs and i said he does n't have short legs . it 's only when his legs are pushed up . ross you sound like you have a cold . do you have a little cold ? how should you know ? because you know how you feel . you know how your body feels . you ca n't feel your body ? you must be really sick then . boys that ca n't feel their body must be real sick right mom ? xxx . because what will i say ? ask me my name first . how should i know ? how did you know that ? oh . no because you knew i was tricking you . why do you want me to ask you ? okay what 's your name ?

i do n't know . you said i 'm going to push the button down or something ? no . i 'm not going to drive i said . do you know how to drive ? xxx . ross tell mommy the whole background to this about how there 's there 's a friend of yours who thinks there is fire_bird and all those . and flier_bird . okay who 's this friend ross ? who are you talking about ? hold on a second . barry barry . is barry in your grade ? okay you sit here and tell me the whole story . you do n't want to to do it lying around ? okay . now what do you think barry what happens with barry . what did you figure out ? and i said maybe it 's true . maybe there is a commercial . and you said may be . maybe what ? the third one ? what is the third one ross ? the third set . okay what are the first two sets of he_man ? what what are the other sets of he_man ? what set is this ross ? yeah you already said battle_cat . okay and what 's the other the second bunch . what does it mean in_between ? how do you know that it 's in_between . how do you know that it 's in_between . why is n't he . why is n't he in the first bunch . why is n't he in the first bunch ? why is n't fakir in the first bunch ? fakir ? yeah why is n't fakir in the first bunch ? he came out when did he come out ? uhhuh . how do you know that he was n't really in the first bunch how do do you know that he was n't part of the first bunch ? he 's the last one of the first bunch . but where do you see him ? where do they and when they make ads where do they put fakir ? they do n't add him anymore . and what is the third bunch ? and what is the third bunch ? but do n't you think that zoar might be flier_bird ? what does zoar do ? what would he be ? okay now tell me a story about all the people in the first bunch . what are they ? supposing i did n't know about them ? oh you do n't me to tell you you do n't want me to tell . but you know something . ross that you did n't figure out . you know you know what 's in the first bunch because you know all those pictures they used to have on the back did fakir ever get in those ? are you sure ? is fakir in the second bunch ? so they never put fakir in any of the bunches . yeah the did . you made a mistake ross . at the end of the first bunch they started to sneak fakir into into those pictures . yup they did . no it wo n't show you in the books it was on the backs of the the toys and we did n't save that . how would that prove it ? where are we going to find that ? you mean at the toy store ? i know how you can tell . the toys have numbers . issue numbers . and you can tell on the back of one of the toys when they sell all of them they come with their numbers . you can compare the numbers . but the interesting thing is that ross realizes that there are two waves of these things that are found why i just barely realized realized myself and he even hypothesizes that there was a third wave and that these unknown toys that this boy barry was talking about must be part of a third wave of these toys . i 'm sure that there will be a third wave . you mean roots ? an orchid . is n't he a terrible little brother ? why is n't he as bad as i think he is ? but he does understand some things . i do understand . do you understand mark ? yes . he does understand ? what does he not understand ? no earlier you said he does n't understand infinity and some other things . no it makes two infinities and eight . and that is an unreal number . that 's a fantasy number . did you know that infinity is a fantasy number ? because you could never really get there in reality . in reality you can get to infinity . right because you 'd have_to live forever . yes . so it 's fantasy . infinity is fantasy . good_night . good night mom . what was the hardest part of your day ? okay what was the hardest part of your day . come on in mark . can we take our backs ? sure . after you come back then you 'll go to the movies . let 's take the other car other car because we might need to to carry big things . it 's ark. it 's a boat . it 's a good question right ross ?

oh really ? how about marian ? marian did n't do it ? you go one two three four five six seven eight . you you count that way . people would get very confused if you went that way . it would n't work out well . you could make it up too if you want . do they still check you for lice at preschool ? ross was pretending he 's a servant he said . at your servants ? at your servants my king . instead of at your service right ? which one is it ? at your servants or at your service ? at your servants my king . the real word is service . no why ross ?
